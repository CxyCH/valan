# VALAN: Vision and Language Agent Navigation

VALAN, short for Vision and Language Agent Navigation, is a scalable
reinforcement learning framework for developing embodied agents, particularly
those found in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) problems. VLN tasks require
agents to interpret natural language instructions to navigate in photo-realistic
environments in order to achieve prescribed navigation goals. VALAN is designed
to be the common learning infrastructure for all VLN problems. VALAN is based on
SEED RL (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06591) and uses its novel off-policy
correction method called V-trace for Reinforcement Learning methods.
